Before that, I was spending I even taking many naps throughout now the day after all the socializing. Haha. After that, I figured I need to take care of myself not to overexert myself with others more. These days, there are way too many group works in school and I've been kind of out of it really from the overstimulation.

89,Introvert,"Unlike shyness and anti-socialism, which are learned psychological attributes, introversion is thought to be a biological state of being over-sensitive to Dopamine (meaning that too much external stimulation such as socialising exhausts them). You can’t ‘fix’ introversion. There’s no need to ‘fix’ introverts – the world needs introverts as much as it needs extroverts."
90,Introvert,"Because intuitives can feel or sense the emotions of others, they often have a difficult time being in crowded places like a mall, concert venue, or fair. Intuitives tend to be more introverted when it comes to social outings. They enjoy one-on-one conversation and detest small talk. Intuitives like to discuss deep topics such as spirituality, mysteries and mystical studies. When they are around a group of people, intuitives might find themselves pulling their energy in and becoming more quiet. Intuitives make great observers of people. They often notice things others tend to miss. If you’re intuitive, it might help you to avoid crowds when possible. If you have to be in a crowded place, give yourself plenty of downtime afterwards so you can recharge your batteries."

306,Introvert,Quarantine doesn't affect you that much.
307,Introvert,"Heck, when quarantine seems like an extended stay in Heaven. No pressure to socialize, solitude in spades, and even the luxury of grocery store delivery is justifiable. Gotta love those awkward moments in the checkout line..."

314,Introvert,"2. In real life, you'd never cheat, because you can only deal with one person at a time."
315,Introvert,"3. You hate typical friendly questions about where you live, what you're eating, etc., because it will lead to more questions and you'll feel totally violated."
316,Introvert,When you let the thread about introversion die.
317,Introvert,"In a similar vein, when you're on a bus/plane and happen to be next to a talkative person. That, my friends, is the stuff of nightmares for me. I sit there dreading it."
318,Introvert,When you prefer a nice ~500 page book to going to an active and boisterous party.
319,Introvert,"When you think these lockdowns are absolutely horrible for society, but feel like such a relief for you."
320,Introvert,"When you can't survive without full, constant internet access."
321,Introvert,"you are going into your second online semester at uni and couldn't care less that it's all virtual. i understand that for some it really affects their ability to learn and study but seriously it's such a relief for me. most of my friends have big issues with it because they miss having contact with people in real time and not only through a screen... hmmm yes, but no thank you. i know being introverted doesn't equal being anti-social though it really comes together for me at times. i was also already told that 'my experience isn't universal' so yeah maybe i shouldn't be so happy about feeling more like myself than under regular circumstances."
322,Introvert,1 (one) imposter detected ^^ it's true though... damn it you're good
323,Introvert,"Well it's not like I can't relate, especially amongst very extroverted people, hahah. Except I'd probably prefer to watch a movie or documentary instead. "
324,Introvert,"hehe sure why not, it was really about the way you phrased it. 'boisterous' fine addition to my vocabulary collection imagine general grievous meme here i was too lazy to dig out"
325,Introvert,good movie to watch while ditching the next party: Interstellar (if you haven't watched it yet)
326,Introvert,"Ah, well I find that introverts don't like boisterous activities, or they just sit back and enjoy watching the chaotic scene unfold. Also, I try not to ditch parties. I'll check out Interstellar some time though, although I'll have to watch that alone as I doubt my family would want to watch an apocalyptic film together."
327,Introvert,"watching the chaos unfold <- definitely me. did i contribute something to it? maybe... reminds me a lot of my senior year in high school. my english teacher couldn't teach for the life of him and so there were constantly at least 3 different conversations going on in one lesson. him trying to teach, one corner debating about the class trip and some others having random conversations. it was truly amazing at times but i would have enjoyed learning something in his class."
328,Introvert,"hm, yes i know what you mean, it is about that balance of ditching every 2nd or 3rd ^^ just not too often"
329,Introvert,"Right, high school classes when the teacher won't quiet everyone or doesn't care enough to teach it well, hahah. Also yeah, ditching too many parties can get you not invited or disinvited, so it's best to not skip out on too many. Hahah. Oh cool, I'll check it out then, my wife and kids like sci-fi as much as I do. "
330,Introvert,"nice, if you do and remember let me know what you thought of it. i watched it in summer and still think about it a lot."
331,Introvert,You know you're an introvert when you'd rather wait in your room hungry than go in the kitchen while others are there.
332,Introvert,You know you're an introverted when you literally have a mental breakdown late at night (and its VERY rare when this happens) for 15 minutes just because you're gonna be forced to socialize with people because you're going back to school. And im highkey embarrassed.
333,Introvert,"-In middle school, I remember this time where a girl asked me what my name was so I shouted, Whatsittooya?"", like 5 times xD"
334,Introvert,You prefer the quarantine.
335,Introvert,You relate to this:
336,Introvert,when a single dose of some talky person on a friday night robs you of half your weekend.
337,Introvert,"i used to go lift at this small 'club' on friday evenings. i actually really enjoyed most of the conversations that would spring up over a session - and most of the time i didn't have any trouble just blanking it out if i needed to. but every so often mr hyper-social would get on a particular roll, and then it could literally take until late on the following day before i started to feel like i was normal again. "
338,Introvert,"i loved him to bits. and tbf he was pretty amenable to being asked to please shut the fucking-fuck up. but it's not like i go around demanding silence wherever i go . . . so typically, by the time i did ask him to please just shut up the damage would already be thoroughly done. the intro/extra problem is real, for both sides."
339,Introvert,"Will do when I reactivate my Netflix account and have a reason to sign up for Disney+. 😄 Reading the plot for a bit, it doesn't sound like a movie I'd watch on a whim and certainly not something I'd want my family to watch. 🙂"
340,Introvert,"oh sorry, i hadn't had in mind that your children might be younger and somehow assumed 12 yo or something... and uplifting was more meant for the ending, which i won't spoil but is actually very clever. so yeah not the best feel good movie but no apocalyptic 2012 feeling either. just wanted to make that clear as it otherwise really seems as if i have a weirdly warped understanding of what a nice family movie is haha"
341,Introvert,"anyway, i'd say there isn't really any benefit for disney+ at the moment or ever. the up coming wandvison series might be, if you're interested in x-men lore but apart from that it's really not worth it."

The anger remains. You are rather deeply offended by the presence of this unwelcome intruder."

351,Introvert,"You wanna yell to people who wanna drag you out for a walk, because it's so mentally unhealthy to sit in the house, alone, all by your self, poor thing"
352,Introvert,"@patrick-the-real-one About 5 years ago I knew someone who worked in a fire tower every year. I was interested, but ended up not applying. According to this website they're hiring for next year. This is in Canada, but maybe they have similar in your country."

363,Introvert,But I like to chat with people online for some reason.
364,Introvert,"I meet my friends once or twice a month, some of them want more then that, maybe like every other day, but I can't handle it, I get exhausted, and feel bad for it."
365,Introvert,You'd rather operate in the background than in the spotlight.
366,Introvert,You hold back your punch lines from actually saying them but have a secret laugh somewhere in that cobwebbed brain of yours! 
367,Introvert,"you're kinda liking this new normal, you know aside from the anxiety about people you love getting horribly ill.

371,Introvert,Introversion means a tendency to the inner world. And you require less interaction.
372,Introvert,Shyness means you are uncomfortable around people. And that you are hesitant to say or behave something.

It's time to muster up the Fe which can be draining. "
376,Introvert,"You are most likely to hang out in the back of everything and the least likely to show up in a picture...""Was Joey there?"".......

The introverted forums explains everything in complete detail, they go on and on , sometimes repeating themselves over and over again. I can hardly get through reading all the blab, i find myself skipping every 10 lines and getting the jest of the whole thing.

If you head over to the ENFP/TP forum, even the ESFP/ENTJ, you won't find masses and masses of data being exchanged. One liners, a few paragraphs here and there. The introverted forums explains everything in complete detail, they go on and on , sometimes repeating themselves over and over again. I can hardly get through reading all the blab, i find myself skipping every 10 lines and getting the jest of the whole thing. Basically Ne can sum up everything that needs to be said in a few lines, often 1. The sub forums are draining, introverts will use up pages in order to get a point across. So yeah, i have to wonder who really talks the most "

Sometimes I choose to be reserved because I don't want people to just count on me all the time to do everything. I hate that.

450,Extravert,"By your argument against the ontological value of NF, the ExTy types don't exist either. It is far more accurate to assess the introversion or extroversion of a personality based on cognitive functions - e.g. primary Ne for an ENTP will mean examining the world outside your mind and seeing where your intuition fits, or even what patterns you can detect. The N type mind doesn't look at things statically, and can even be blindsided by the simple at times. Moreover, the NF types depending on which NF type you're talking about can process primarily through intuition or through feeling, internally or externally, depending on their primary function as well. The NF can process an experience, and compare against some emotional abstraction which I'll fully admit to being incapable of understanding. In either case, just as with the NT types, they tend to live in a world above Plato's divided line, rather than an Aristotelian concrete world."

601,Extravert,When you complain to 500 friends on facebook about how lonely/bored you are.
602,Extravert,"You know you're an Extrovert... because the alternative ""You know you're an Introvert"" thread has like ten times as many replies and you're gonna be going out with friends in an hour, thus not allowing time to help this place reach their number by much!"

606,Extravert,"When you're so hyperactive and lost in your own head, that looking the mirror surprises you. What I mean is that I get so lost in the moment that I feel my body is a mere vessel, and that I forget I'm shock to see yourself looking back at you."
607,Extravert,You can't be alone for too long. (Without contact.)

625,Extravert,"It is funny how the stereotypes of extroverts and introverts still exist. I am an extrovert and believed I was an introvert from when I was 12 because everyone seems to think only introverts are quiet, shy and calm/peaceful. I did not dare to talk to strangers, I was afraid because I was shy. I kind of hate small talk, maybe bc my mom is an INFJ, but yeah..who would say that about extroverts? I can join small talk for 30 min, then I prefer to be alone or with people that have something interesting to talk about. Sorry this is all about ME, ghehe."

650,Extravert,will enjoy games that require teamwork or challenging others at a game and being motivated by others in general.

708,Extravert,"You know the thing i find the most ironic in terms of PerC in itself is this. If you head over to the ENFP/TP forum, even the ESFP/ENTJ, you won't find masses and masses of data being exchanged. One liners, a few paragraphs here and there. The introverted forums explains everything in complete detail, they go on and on , sometimes repeating themselves over and over again. I can hardly get through reading all the blab, i find myself skipping every 10 lines and getting the jest of the whole thing. Basically Ne can sum up everything that needs to be said in a few lines, often 1. The sub forums are draining, introverts will use up pages in order to get a point across.
